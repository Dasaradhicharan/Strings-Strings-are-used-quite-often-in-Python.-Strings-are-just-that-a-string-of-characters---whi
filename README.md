Strings Strings are used quite often in Python. Strings, are just that, a string of characters - which s anything you can type on the keyboard in one keystroke, like a letter, a number, or a back- slash. Python recognizes single and double quotes as the same thing, the beginning and end of the strings. 1 >>> "string list" 2 'string list' 3 >>> 'string list' 4 'string list' What if you have a quote in the middle of the string? Python needs help to recognize quotes as part of the English language and not as part of the Python language. 1 >>> "I ’cant do that" 2 'I ’cant do that' 3 >>> "He said \"no\" to me" 4 'He said "no" to me' Now you can also join (concatenate) strings with use of variables as well. 1 >>> a = "first" 2 >>> b = "last" 3 >>> a + b 4 'firstlast' If you want a space in between, you can change a to the word with a space after. 1 >>> a = "first " 2 >>> a + b 3 'first last' There are different string methods for you to choose from as well - like upper(), lower(), replace(), and count(). upper() does just what it sounds like - changes your string to all uppercase letters. 1 >>> str = 'woah!' 2 >>> str.upper() 3 'WOAH!' Can you guess what lower() does?
